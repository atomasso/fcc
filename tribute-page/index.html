	    <ul class="obj-center">
	   		<li><strong>1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born in the village of Smiljan near Gospić, as the fourth child of the Orthodox priest Milutin and his wife Georgina (Đuka)- Mandić.</li>
	    	<li><strong>1875</strong> - Enrolled at the High Technical School in Graz, learns 20 hours a day</li>
	    	<li><strong>1880</strong> - Continues to study in Prague, but is forced to interrupt studies due to lack of funds</li>	    	
	    	<li><strong>1881</strong> - Finds employment in Budapest in the Central Telegraph Office, thanks to family connections. Improves some devices and discovers methods for amplifying the voice in telephony. Invents the voice amplifier.</li>	    
			<li><strong>1882</strong> - In Budapest during a walk with his friend Sigety comes upon the idea of a rotating magnetic field, and thereupon elaborates all types of electric motors. Draws the scheme of the electric motor by stick in the sand, the invention which he patented six years later in America.</li>
			<li><strong>1881</strong> - Goes to Paris and works in Edison's subsidiary company where he is received by the Director Charles Batchellor. His field of work are direct current machines. He becomes a known expert.</li>
			<li><strong>1883</strong> - In Strasburg he works on automatic regulators of illumination and builds the first motor without the commutator. On the construction of a power plant he produced a two-phase induction motor which he demonstrated on 10 July.</li>		
			<li><strong>1884</strong> - Returns to Paris. Unsuccessful in procuring funds for his constructions. Disappointed by lack of understanding in Europe and upon the recommendation of the director of Edison's company goes to the USA and works several months in Edison's company "Machine Works" in New York. At the beginning he was offered maintenance jobs for 18 dollars a week. Edison promised him a reward of 50,000 dollars if he improves the dynamo-machine. Several weeks after this verbal agreement, Tesla fulfilled his promise and asked of Edison his money. Edison replied that it was only a joke. Disappointed with the answer, Tesla leaves the job and the company. Conflict with Edison will last for years.</li>		
			<li><strong>1885</strong> - Tesla sets up his own company for the production of electric-arc lamps (lamps with electrodes which produce a strong light by establishing an electric arc).</li>
			<li><strong>1885</strong> - Tesla's laboratory in New York burned down. In July a new laboratory was built and begins work. Tesla constructs a transmitter-receiver radio station.</li>
			<li><strong>1886</strong> - Patent applications for dynamo-electric machine and thermo-magnetic motor.</li>
			<li><strong>1888</strong> - He holds a lecture in the American Institute of Electrical Engineers about the new system of electric motors and transformers; George Westinghouse buys out his patents.</li>			
			<li><strong>1891</strong> - Tesla becomes and American citizen; He files applications for a number of patents in the area of high frequency currents and high voltage; on 20 May he gives a lecture with experiments on Columbia University in New York. He invented the coil, later called the Tesla coil, which is in broad use even today in televisions, radios and other electrical appliances.</li>
			<li><strong>1893</strong> - Tesla's generator was demonstrated at an exhibition in Chicago. The Columbus Exhibition was conceived as a celebration of 400 years of the discovery of America, which craved for spectacle. So, on 1 May 1893 the first electro-technical fair in history was held. This opened the way for the building of a hydro power plant on the Niagara Falls, Tesla's long-standing dream.</li>
			<li><strong>1896</strong> - In December 1896 in Zagreb he becomes a honorary member of the Yugoslav Academy of Arts and Sciences. Conducts experiments with X rays.</li>			
			<li><strong>1902</strong> - Tesla files a patent application for a device for the transmission of electric energy.</li>
			<li><strong>1908</strong> - Tesla works on the improvement of turbines.</li>
			<li><strong>1909</strong> - Patent application for fluid propulsion, for turbine without blades, for speed-indicator, valvular conduit, lightning rod, flow-meter, ship's speed-indicator, frequency meter.</li>
			<li><strong>1912</strong> - Tesla and T. A. Edison were proposed for the Nobel Prize.</li>			
			<li><strong>1918</strong> - Tesla patents the lighting rod.</li>
			<li><strong>1926</strong> - He receives an honorary doctorate in technical sciences from the Technical Faculty in Belgrade. On the same year he is awarded the honorary doctorate by the University of Zagreb. </li>
			<li><strong>1938</strong> - In Hotel New Yorker Tesla spoke about the wireless transmission of electric energy and the death rays.</li>			
			<li><strong>1943</strong> - Tesla died in his hotel room in New York under strange circumstances.</li>
